## Who
-One can be used as a fun game it can be upgraded to have more features.

## What
-This project idea is to play with computer.

## Where
-This project idea is available both on VSC and Github.
 
 ## Why
 -this project uses simple function it is very compact to work.
 
 ## How
 -By implementing mutilevel program it can be achived
 -this project requires a lost cost of development.
 
 
   
   ## High Level Requirements:
      This project can be implemented by using c language in both windows and linux os.   
      This project requires a random integer generator function.                           
   ## Low level Requirements:
      The Random number has to generate the numbers with in the specified range of number.
      The comparasion of the character from the player input and the computer generated has to be taken care.
